# Plane_Village_Dataset_TransferLearning_Pytorch
Transfer learning or fetching pretrained weights is one of the most utilizing way to train your model and classify the classes based on it. In this repository, transfer learning has been perfomed on different models in pytorch and flops, parameters ,training time, best accuracy as well as testing accurcy was performed and compared among different models.

Dataset used for 38 classes - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset
