# Plane_Village_Dataset_TransferLearning_Pytorch
Transfer learning or fetching pretrained weights is one of the most utilizing way to train your model and classify the classes based on it. In this repository , transfer learning has been perfomed on different models in pytorch and calculated flops, parameters ,training time, best accuracy as well as testing accurcy.
