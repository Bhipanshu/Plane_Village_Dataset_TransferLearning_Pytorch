# Plane_Village_Dataset_TransferLearning_Pytorch
Transfer learning or fetching pretrained weights is one of the most utilizing way to train your model and classify the classes based on it. In this repository, transfer learning has been perfomed on different models in pytorch and flops, parameters ,training time, best accuracy as well as testing accurcy was performed and compared among different models.


Dataset used for 38 classes - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset
Dataset used for 15 classes - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease

Just pass the above link to the data_dir path mentioned in every file.
The model can be used to test on single images as well. Relative code has been commented out in each file

Models on which Transfer Learning was performed are as follows-

1. Alexnet
2. Googlenet
3. VGG16
4. Resnet50
5. Densenet
